# Final-Project
EPI 590R
Julia Singer

Used age_gap dataset containing a total of 13 variables to start.
I got rid of 4, changed the age vectors for actors 1 and 2 to numeric data, and created a new variable vector for the age difference between actors 1 and 2
Used different variables for regression, created a histogram of the age differences by # of movies
Created a function for the mean of the variable age_difference
Used inline statements to pull data from different tables, cross-referenced both the table and histogram
