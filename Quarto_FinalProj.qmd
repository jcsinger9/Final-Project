tbl_summary(
	agegap,
	by = character_1_gender,
	include = c(actor_2_age, actor_1_age,
							character_2_gender),
	label = list(
		actor_2_age ~ "Age of Actor 2",

		character_2_gender ~ "Gender Identity of Character 2"
		),

table_summ <- tbl_summary(

		character_2_gender ~ "Gender Identity of Character 2"),

inline_text(table_summ, variable = "actor_2_age", 
						column = "0")

```

In @tbl-1, the median age of female actors recorded as Actor 2 is `r inline_text(table_summ, variable = "actor_2_age", column = "0")`.

```{r}

actor1age_table <- tbl_uvregression(
	agegap,
	y = actor_1_age,
	include = c(actor_2_age, age_difference, character_1_gender,
							character_2_gender),
method = lm)

```

```{r}
agediffvalue <- inline_text(actor1age_table, variable = "age_difference")

avgact1age <- mean(agegap$actor_1_age, na.rm = TRUE)

avgact2age <- mean(agegap$actor_2_age, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The average age of Actor 1 actors is `r round(avgact1age, 1)`.

The average age of Actor 2 actors is `r round(avgact2age, 1)`.

The majority of actors recorded as Actor 1 are male, whereas the majority of actors recorded as Actor 2 are female.

```{r}
#| label: fig-hist
#| fig-cap: Histogram of Age Difference Across Number of Movies

hist(agegap$age_difference, xlab = "Age Difference",
		 ylab = "Number of Movies", main = "Age Gap Histogram")


```

In @fig-hist, the relationship between number of movies and age difference is inversely related. As the age difference between Actors 1 and 2 increases, the frequency for number of movies decreases.

```{r}
mean_age <- function(age_difference) {
	t <- length(age_difference)
	mean <- sum(age_difference, na.rm = TRUE)/t
	return(mean)
}

avgagediff <- mean_age(agegap$age_difference)
```

The average difference in ages between Actor 1 and Actor 2 is `r round(avgagediff, 1)` years.
```         
```
